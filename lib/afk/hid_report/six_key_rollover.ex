defmodule AFK.HIDReport.SixKeyRollover do
  @moduledoc """
  Implements the `AFK.HIDReport` behaviour to produce a standard 6-key rollover
  USB keyboard HID report.

  The report is an 8-byte binary with the first byte being a bitmap of modifier
  keys that are currently active, the second byte being zero (reserved), and the
  following 6 bytes are the first 6 key scancodes that are active. Any
  additionally active keys are ignored in this report.
